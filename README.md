## Introduction

[AgiBot X1](https://www.zhiyuan-robot.com/qzproduct/169.html) is a modular humanoid robot with high dof developed and open-sourced by AgiBot. It is built upon AgiBot's open-source framework AimRT as middleware and using reinforcement learning for locomotion control.

本项目是真机部署版本x1_infer代码，增加软限位逻辑

## Running Instructions

### Preparation for Launch

- Install [GCC-13](https://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc-13/).

- Install [cmake](https://cmake.org/download/) (version 3.26 or above).

- Install [ONNX Runtime](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime).

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake git libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler

git clone --recursive https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime

cd onnxruntime
./build.sh --config Release --build_shared_lib --parallel

cd build/Linux/Release/
sudo make install
```

- Install `ROS2 Humble` and configure the environment variables. For detailed instructions, visit the [ROS2 official website](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html).

- Install dependencies for the simulation environment.

```bash
sudo apt install jstest-gtk libglfw3-dev libdart-external-lodepng-dev
```

- Install the Linux [realtime kernel patch](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/realtime/start) if real-robot debugging is needed.

*It will be very slow or even fail to download AimRT's numerous dependencies from default sources. Therefore, we provide environment variables `DOWNLOAD_FLAGS` for the download based on the Gitee source in `url_gitee.bashrc`. Simply source `url_gitee.bashrc` before running `build.sh` and add environment variable parameters for the Gitee source.*

After completing the above steps, execute the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source url_gitee.bashrc

# Build
./build.sh $DOWNLOAD_FLAGS

# Test
./test.sh $DOWNLOAD_FLAGS
```

### Launch Simulation

Before starting, it is necessary to connect the handle receiver.

```bash
cd build/
./run_sim.sh
```

### Launch on Real Robot

Export your library path first, **just need to execute once**.

```bash
# Open "/etc/ld.so.conf" as root
sudo vi /etc/ld.so.conf

# Add this path to the end of "/etc/ld.so.conf"
/opt/ros/humble/lib
{YourProjectSource}/build/install/lib

# Refresh system env
sudo ldconfig
```

Ready to launch.

```bash
cd build/
./run.sh
```
